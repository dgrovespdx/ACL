ACL readme
==========

Project: ACL: ACL is a concatenative programming language.  
              ACL is a command line applicagtion released as open source 
			  under the BSD license.

Developer: Don Groves

Development Environment: XCode on a MacBook Pro laptop running Mac OS.

Development Language: C.

I am seeking experienced C programmers to join the project.

Immediate needs are testing ACL in other environments and possibly joining 
as a developer. You can develop in any compatible environment.

If you are an expert C programmer, you can probably suggest improvements
to my implementation. I welcome such suggestions.

There will be a github repository in the near future, but for now, if you 
are interested, do the right thing with dgrovespdx, gmail, and com and I 
will send you the source code and design document.
