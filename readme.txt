ACL readme
==========

ACL is a concatenative programming language. ACL is currently a command line application with plans for a GTK version to provide a GUI.

Developer: Don Groves

Development Environment: XCode on a MacBook Pro laptop running Mac OS.

Development Language: C.

I am seeking experienced C programmers to join the project.

Immediate needs are testing ACL in other environments and possibly joining 
as a developer. You can develop in any compatible environment.

If you are an expert C programmer, you can probably suggest improvements
to my implementation. I welcome such suggestions.

The file ACLcoding.txt gives examples of coding in ACL.

The file test.acl is a trivial example of how to create an ACL program. ACL programs are executed by main(filename).
